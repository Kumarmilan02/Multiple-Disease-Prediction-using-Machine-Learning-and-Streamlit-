# Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Streamlit App:-
- This repository holds a Machine Learning (ML) project that concentrates on forecasting various illnesses through a Streamlit web application. 
- The project encompasses liver disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and kidney disease.

## Introduction:-
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for several diseases based on relevant medical data.By leveraging ML techniques and building a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, users can input their medical information and receive predictions about their potential risk or diagnosis of these diseases.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (ML) libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn,)
- Streamlit
- Git and GitHub

## Project Structure
- data/: Contains datasets used for training and testing the ML models.
- saved models/: Stores trained ML models for disease prediction.
- app/: Includes the Streamlit web application code.
- requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository to your local machine: 'git clone https://github.com/Kumarmilan02/Multiple-Disease-Prediction.git'
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd Multiple-Disease-Prediction`
- Install the required dependencies: 
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app/multipledisease pred.py`
- Access the web application by opening the provided URL in your browser.
